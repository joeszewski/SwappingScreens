# SwappingScreens
This repo contains a demo app that contains 3 different VCs and 2 different segues between them

The 1st VC is the Login. The 2nd VC is is a Music Lisc.  The 3rd VC is the Play Song VC.

Segue from 1st to 2nd is triggered by pressing the the Login button.

Seque from the 2nd to the 3rd is triggered within the VC code when the "Load 3rd Screen" btn is pressed.

The 2nd and 3rd screens also have a back button that dismisses the current VC and displays the previous.
